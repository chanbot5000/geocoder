geocoder
========

GISCollective's very own geocoder!

Use this website to geocode points based on addresses. The website uses the US Census Bureau's geocoder, so only addresses within the United States are valid.

To Do:
*Add options panel, to include:
	-toggle center & zoom on geocoded point when coded
	-configuring custom zoom level for geocoding, if center & zoom is selected
	-select basemap tiles (I'm not committed to this yet but it could be a nice option)
	-change point styling
